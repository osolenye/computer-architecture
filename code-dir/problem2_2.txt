x = 2^n
e.g. x = 2048 = 2^11. It's 100000000000 (1 and 11 zeroes just like power of 2)


i = 0, x = 1
i = 1, x = 2 
i = 2, x = 4 
i = 3, x = 8

n = 11 = 3 + 4*2 i = 3, j = 2

So when i = 3, for hex first digit will be 8, so it's 0x8 and amount of zeros is j. j = 2, so 0x800


n	2^n(dec)	2^n(hex)

5	32		0x20
23	8388608		0x800000
13	2^13		0x2000
12	2^12		0x1000
6	64		0x40
8	256		0x100
